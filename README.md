<h1><b>"WEATHER MONITORING SYSTEM"</b></h1>
<p>IOT device to monitor enviornmental changes with integration of dynamic changes</p>
<p>It basically monitors : TEMPERATURE, HUMIDITY, RAIN , PRESSURE, ALTITUDE</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>
This Weather Monitoring System is an IoT project designed to monitor and report weather conditions. It integrates various sensors to provide accurate data on several environmental parameters. The system is built around the ESP32 microcontroller, ensuring efficient data processing and seamless communication with other components.

<h2>Components</h2>
ESP32 Microcontroller: Acts as the central processing unit, managing data collection and transmission.
BMP180 Pressure Sensor: Measures atmospheric pressure with high precision.
DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor: Provides reliable readings of temperature and humidity levels.
Rain Sensor: Detects the presence and intensity of rain.
Breadboard Platform: Serves as the assembly base, facilitating easy connections and modifications.

<h3>Features</h3>
Accurate Data Collection: The combination of BMP180, DHT11, and Rain Sensor ensures comprehensive weather monitoring.
Seamless Integration: All components are well-integrated with the ESP32, providing a cohesive and efficient system.
Easy Assembly: The use of a breadboard platform allows for straightforward setup and expansion.
Real-time Monitoring: Capable of providing real-time updates on weather conditions.

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Clone the Repository:</p>

<li>Open bash</li>
<li>Copy code: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-monitoring-system.git</li>
<li>cd weather-monitoring-system</li>
<p>Setup Hardware:</p>

<li>Connect the BMP180, DHT11, and Rain Sensor to the ESP32 microcontroller as per the circuit diagram provided in the repository.
Assemble the components on the breadboard platform.</li>
<p>Upload Code:</p>

<li>Open the project in your preferred Arduino IDE.
Select the appropriate board and port for the ESP32.
Upload the code to the ESP32.</li>

<p>Run the System:</p>

<li>Power the ESP32.</li>
<li>Monitor the weather data through the serial monitor or any connected display/output device.</li>
<li>Once the system is up and running, it will continuously collect data from the connected sensors. You can view the data in real-time and use it for various applications such as weather forecasting, environmental research, and more.</li>
